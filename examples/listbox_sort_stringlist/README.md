# ListBox and StringListModel with Sorter example

This example demonstrates how to use `gtk::ListBox` in combination with
a StringList model and StringSorter with a PropertyExpression.

It sets up a `gtk::ListBox` containing an Inscription on each row.
The rows are sorted alphabetically.

In addition, it is possible to delete rows.

Run it by executing:

```bash
cargo run --bin list_box_sort_stringlist
``
