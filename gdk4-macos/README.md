# Rust GDK 4 Macos bindings

The project website is [here](https://gtk-rs.org/).

Rust bindings of GDK 4's Macos backend,
part of [gtk4-rs](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/).

GDK is an intermediate layer that isolates GTK from the details of the windowing system.
GDK Macos contains functions specific to the Macos backend.

## Minimum supported Rust version

Currently, the minimum supported Rust version is `1.80`.

## Documentation

- The Rust API [Stable](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/docs/gdk4_macos)/[Development](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/git/docs/gdk4_macos/)
- [The C API](https://docs.gtk.org/gdk4-macos/)
- [GTK Installation instructions](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/)

## Using

We recommend using [crates from crates.io](https://crates.io/keywords/gtk-rs),
as [demonstrated here](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/docs/gtk4/index.html#library-versions).

If you want to track the bleeding edge, use the git dependency instead:

```toml
[dependencies]
gdk-wayland = { git = "https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs.git", package = "gdk4-wayland" }
```

Avoid mixing versioned and git crates like this:

```toml
# This will not compile
[dependencies]
gdk-macos = {version = "0.1", package = "gdk4-macos"}
gdk-wayland = { git = "https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs.git", package = "gdk4-wayland" }
```

### Features
