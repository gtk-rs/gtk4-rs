# gtk4-rs ![CI](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

A group of crates that aims to provide complete [GTK](https://gtk.org/) 4 bindings. This repository contains all the "core" crates of GTK 4.

- [GTK](./gtk4)
- [GDK](./gdk4): An intermediate layer which isolates GTK from the details of the windowing system.
  - [GDK Wayland](./gdk4-wayland): Wayland backend specific functions.
  - [GDK Win32](./gdk4-win32): Windows backend specific functions.
  - [GDK X11](./gdk4-x11): X backend specific functions.
- [GSK](./gsk4): An intermediate layer which isolates GTK from the details of the OpenGL or Vulkan implementation.

The GTK 4 crates also depends on other libraries part of the platform like:

- [GLib](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs-core/tree/master/glib)
- [Gio](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs-core/tree/master/gio)
- [Graphene](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs-core/tree/master/graphene)
- [Cairo](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs-core/tree/master/cairo)
- [Pango](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs-core/tree/master/pango)

Those are common with the GTK 3 and GStreamer bindings and are part of the [gtk-rs-core](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs-core) repository.

For more information about each crate, please refer to their `README.md` file in their directory.

## Ecosystem

The `gtk4-rs` repository contains Rust crates for GTK 4. However there is a large ecosystem of `GObject` libraries and many of these
libraries have Rust bindings based on the tooling included in `gtk-rs`.
Of particular note:

* [gtk-rs-core](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs-core) - bindings for some of the core libraries such as `glib`, `gio`, `pango`, `graphene`
* [gstreamer-rs](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer-rs) - bindings for the GStreamer media framework

Additionally, Rust bindings for various libraries are hosted on
[GNOME's GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org) instance and can be found at
<https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Rust>.

When using crates that are not part of the `gtk4-rs` repository, you will
need to be careful and ensure that they do not pull in incompatible versions of core
crates like `glib-rs`.

### Built with GTK4 Rust bindings

Below is a list of applications built using the Rust bindings of GTK 4

- [Solanum](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Solanum)
- [Shortwave](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Shortwave)
- [Authenticator](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Authenticator)
- [Health](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Cogitri/Health)
- [Video Trimmer](https://gitlab.gnome.org/YaLTeR/video-trimmer)

## Contributing

The bindings are composed of two parts:

- Automatically generated ones using [gir]
- Manual parts

The automatic ones can be generated using the [`generator.py`](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir/blob/master/generator.py) script

```bash
python3 ./generator.py
```

If you didn't do so yet, please check out all the submodules before via

```bash
$ git submodule update --checkout
```

All the crates except `gtk4-macros` follow this structure

```text
   ./crate 
   ├── Gir.toml
   ├── README.md
   ├── src
   │   ╰── auto
   ├── sys
   ╰── tests
```

- `README.md`: Explanations about the crate itself and eventually some details.
- `Gir.toml`: Used by [gir] to generate most of the code.
- `src`: Contains the source code of the crate.
- `src/auto`: Contains the automatically generated part of the source code.
- `sys`: Contains the 1:1 bindings of the C API.
