# The Main Event Loop

We now got comfortable using callbacks, but how do they actually work?
All of this happens asynchronously, so there must be something managing the events and scheduling the responses.
Unsurprisingly, this is called the main event loop.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="img/main_event_loop.png" alt="Diagram showing the main event loop"/></div>

The main loop manages all kinds of events — from mouse clicks and keyboard presses to file events.
It does all of that within the same thread.
Quickly iterating between all tasks gives the illusion of parallelism.
That is why you can move the window at the same time as a progress bar is growing.

However, you surely saw GUIs that became unresponsive, at least for a few seconds.
That happens when a single task takes too long.
The following example uses [`std::thread::sleep`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.sleep.html) to represent a long-running task.

Filename: <a class=file-link href="https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/blob/master/book/listings/main_event_loop/1/main.rs">listings/main_event_loop/1/main.rs</a>

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/main_event_loop/1/main.rs}}
```

After we press the button, the GUI is completely frozen for five seconds.
We can't even move the window.
The `sleep` call is an artificial example,
but it is not unusual wanting to run a slightly longer operation in one go.

## How to Avoid Blocking the Main Loop

In order to avoid blocking the main loop we can spawn a new task with [`gio::spawn_blocking`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/latest/docs/gio/fn.spawn_blocking.html) and let the operation run there.

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/main_event_loop/2/main.rs:callback}}
```

<div style="text-align:center">
 <video autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="vid/main_event_loop_2.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p>A video which shows that after pressing the button, the window can still be moved</p>
 </video>
</div>

> Luckily, Rust's safety guarantees allow you to stop worrying about the nasty bugs that concurrency tends to bring.


Typically, we want to keep track of the work in the task.
In our case, we don't want the user to spawn additional tasks while an existing one is still running.
In order to achieve that we can create a channel with the crate [`async-channel`](https://docs.rs/async-channel/latest/async_channel/index.html).
Let's add it by executing the following in the terminal:

```
cargo add async-channel
```

We want to send a `bool` to inform, whether we want the button to react to clicks or not.
Since we send in a separate thread, we can use [`send_blocking`](https://docs.rs/async-channel/latest/async_channel/struct.Sender.html#method.send_blocking).
But what about receiving?
Every time we get a message we want to set the sensitivity of the button according to the `bool` we've received.
However, we don't want to block the main loop while waiting for a message to receive.
That is the whole point of the exercise after all!

We solve that problem by waiting for messages to receive in an [`async`](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/) block.
We spawn that `async` block on the glib main loop with [`spawn_local`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/latest/docs/glib/struct.MainContext.html#method.spawn_local) (from other threads than the main thread [`spawn`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/latest/docs/glib/struct.MainContext.html#method.spawn) has to be used).

Filename: <a class=file-link href="https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/blob/master/book/listings/main_event_loop/3/main.rs">listings/main_event_loop/3/main.rs</a>

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/main_event_loop/3/main.rs:callback}}
```

As you can see, spawning a task still doesn't freeze our user interface.
Now, we also can't spawn multiple tasks at the same time since the button becomes insensitive after the first task has been spawned.
After the task is finished, the button becomes sensitive again.

<div style="text-align:center">
 <video autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="vid/main_event_loop_3.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p>The button now stops being responsive for 10 seconds after being pressed</p>
 </video>
</div>

What if the task is asynchronous by nature?
Let's use [`glib::timeout_future_seconds`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/latest/docs/glib/fn.timeout_future_seconds.html) as representation for our task instead of `std::thread::slepp`.
It returns a [`std::future::Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html), which means we can `await` on it within an `async` context.
The converted code looks and behaves very similar to the multithreaded code.

Filename: <a class=file-link href="https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/blob/master/book/listings/main_event_loop/4/main.rs">listings/main_event_loop/4/main.rs</a>

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/main_event_loop/4/main.rs:callback}}
```

Since we are single-threaded again, we can even get rid of the channel while achieving the same result.

Filename: <a class=file-link href="https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/blob/master/book/listings/main_event_loop/5/main.rs">listings/main_event_loop/5/main.rs</a>

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/main_event_loop/5/main.rs:callback}}
```

But why did we not do the same thing with our multithreaded example?

```rust ,no_run,compile_fail
# use std::{thread, time::Duration};
# 
# use glib::{clone, MainContext, PRIORITY_DEFAULT};
# use gtk::{glib, gio};
# use gtk::prelude::*;
# use gtk::{Application, ApplicationWindow, Button};
# 
# fn main() {
#     // Create a new application
#     let app = Application::builder()
#        .application_id("org.gtk_rs.MainEventLoop6")
#        .build();
#
#     // Connect to "activate" signal
#     app.connect_activate(build_ui);
# 
#     // Get command-line arguments
#     let args: Vec<String> = args().collect();
#     // Run the application
#     app.run(&args);
# }
# 
# // When the application is launched…
# fn build_ui(application: &Application) {
#     // Create a window
#     let window = ApplicationWindow::builder()
#         .application(application)
#         .title("My GTK App")
#         .build();
# 
#     // Create a button
#     let button = Button::builder()
#         .label("Press me!")
#         .margin_top(12)
#         .margin_bottom(12)
#         .margin_start(12)
#         .margin_end(12)
#         .build();
# 
    // DOES NOT COMPILE!
    // Connect to "clicked" signal of `button`
    button.connect_clicked(move |button| {
        button.clone();
        // The long running operation runs now in a separate thread
        gio::spawn_blocking(move || {
            // Deactivate the button until the operation is done
            button.set_sensitive(false);
            let five_seconds = Duration::from_secs(5);
            thread::sleep(five_seconds);
            // Activate the button again
            button.set_sensitive(true);
        });
    });
# 
#     // Add button
#     window.set_child(Some(&button));
#     window.present();
# }
```

Simply because we would get this error message:

```console
error[E0277]: `NonNull<GObject>` cannot be shared between threads safely

help: within `gtk4::Button`, the trait `Sync` is not implemented for `NonNull<GObject>`
```

After reference cycles we found the second disadvantage of GTK GObjects: They are not thread safe.

So when should you spawn an `async` block, and when should you spawn a thread?
- If you have `async` functions for your IO-bound operations at your disposal, feel free to spawn them on the main loop.
- If your operation is computation-bound or there is no `async` function available, you have to spawn threads.
