When you want to modify the styling and layout of your GTK app you use [CSS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets).
If you are not already familiar with CSS, now would be a good time to make yourself familiar with its [syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Syntax).
