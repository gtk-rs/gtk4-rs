# Listings

Here you can find the listings used by the code snippets of the book.

Each listing can be run by changing the current working directory to this folder and then executing:

```bash
cargo run --bin [example_name]_[number]
```

For example, if you want to run the listing in subfolder "hello_world/3", execute:

```bash
cargo run --bin hello_world_3
```
