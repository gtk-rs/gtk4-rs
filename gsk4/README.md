# Rust GSK 4 bindings

The project website is [here](https://gtk-rs.org/).

Rust bindings of [GSK 4](https://docs.gtk.org/gsk4/), part
of [gtk4-rs](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/).

GSK is an intermediate layer that isolates GTK from the details of the OpenGL or
Vulkan implementation.

## Minimum supported Rust version

Currently, the minimum supported Rust version is `1.63.0`.

## Documentation

- The Rust API [Stable](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/docs/gsk4)/[Development](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/git/docs/gsk4/)
- [The C API](https://docs.gtk.org/gsk4/)
- [GTK Installation instructions](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/)

## Using

We recommend using [crates from crates.io](https://crates.io/keywords/gtk-rs),
as [demonstrated here](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/docs/gtk4/index.html#library-versions).

If you want to track the bleeding edge, use the git dependency instead:

```toml
[dependencies]
gsk = { git = "https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs.git", package = "gsk4" }
```

Avoid mixing versioned and git crates like this:

```toml
# This will not compile
[dependencies]
gdk = {version = "0.1", package = "gdk4"}
gsk = { git = "https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs.git", package = "gsk4" }
```

### Features
